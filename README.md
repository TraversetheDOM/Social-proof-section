## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Continued working on my layout structure and I got to use the `transform:translateX() and translateY()` property for the testimonials and the reviews which was a good learning experience for me.

You cna see some snippets on how I was able to do that below:

```css
.social_proof_card:nth-child(1) {
  transform: translateX(-20%);
}

.social_proof_card:nth-child(2) {
  transform: translateX(-10%);
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to do more frontmentor challenges/projects to help me develop and improve my HTML and CSS skills.
